      Hi I'm Ashley — web developer, support engineer, and amateur weightlifter.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hey there, thanks for visiting my website. I’m a programmer — web
      developer, to be specific. For work, I'm an application support engineer
      at Siemens where I work on SaaS solutions for lots of different companies.
      Outside of tech stuff, I lift weights at the gym and drive around to
      random places.

      I use this website to present my side projects. I listed them in reverse
      chronological order. Some of them are pretty old and don't really reflect
      my current skills, but I put them here for the nostalgia and to show how
      far I've come.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to read more about them below.</p>

          A task management system that lets users create custom milestones for
          each task. I got the idea when I was at work. I needed a really simple
          way to be able to keep track of my todos, but I couldn't find an app
          that had everything I was looking for. So I'm making this now. Work in
          progress.

          Hey, that's the name of the website (IYKYK). I wanted it to feel as
          clutter-free as possible, so I went with a minimalist style.
          Originally I built it with React and SCSS, but honestly this website
          doesn't need all of that.

          A virtual keyboard (the music kind, not the computer kind) that lets
          users play their desktop, tablet, or phone as a mini keyboard. I
          started this project way back in July 2022, and in the past year and a
          half, I've updated the code and design to get to where it is now. It's
          my pet project.

          Find and save recipes from all over the web. This was my first full
          stack app, so needless to say I learned a lot while making it. I use
          the Edamam Recipe API to grab recipes. I also added a login system so
          users can save their favorite recipes (unless it's Hawaiian pizza,
          then they're put on a list).
