        I'm an application support engineer (for work) and developer (for play). Outside of tech stuff, I lift weights
        and drive around to random places I've never been to.

        I use this space to showcase my personal projects. Feel free to read more about them below.

                A virtual keyboard (the music kind, not the computer kind) that lets users play their desktop,
                tablet, or phone as a mini keyboard. I started this project in July 2022, updating and maintaining
                the code and design in
                the time since.

                Hey, that's the name of the website (IYKYK). I wanted it to feel uncluttered, so I went for a
                minimalist style. Originally I built it with React and SCSS, but honestly this website doesn't need
                all of that.

                A web app to find and save recipes from all over the web. This was my first app with a backend
                component, so needless to say I learned a lot while making it.
