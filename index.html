            I develop and scale enterprise SaaS applications for companies around the world. Outside of tech stuff, I
            lift weights and re-watch episodes of 90s sitcoms.
            <br /><br />
            I use this space to showcase my personal projects. Feel free to read more about them below.

                        Basically Jira without all of the extra stuff. I need an app to help me keep track of my
                        personal projects, but the solutions that I've found are either too simple or too complex for my
                        needs. So I'm making this. Work in progress.

                        A virtual keyboard (the music kind, not the computer kind) that lets users play their desktop,
                        tablet, or phone as a mini keyboard. I started this project in July 2022, updating and
                        maintaining the code and design in the time since.

                        A web app to find and save recipes from all over the web. This was my first app with a backend
                        component, so needless to say I learned a lot while making it.
