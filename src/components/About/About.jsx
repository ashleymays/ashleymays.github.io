                Cool, you found my website. Glad you&apos;re here. Let me introduce myself, then
                (don&apos;t worry I&apos;ll keep it short I know you&apos;re busy).
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is <s className="strikethrough">Ashlee</s>{' '}
                <s className="strikethrough">Ashleigh</s> Ashley, and I&apos;m a programmer. Web
                developer, to be specific. Basically I spend a lot of my time online with headphones
                on.
            </p>
            <p>Here&apos;s more on my background, if you&apos;re interested:</p>
            <p>
                I started programming in college (and before you ask, no I don&apos;t have a CS
                degree, only a math degree that collects dust in my closet). It was just a degree
                requirement at first, but I was really into it by the end of the class. A few years
                of hobby projects, and eventually I got a career in tech. Now I&apos;m an
                application support engineer solving interesting problems every day.
