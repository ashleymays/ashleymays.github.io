                Cool, you found my website. Let me introduce myself, then (don&apos;t worry I’ll
                keep it short I know you’re busy).
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is <s className="strikethrough">Ashlee</s>{' '}
                <s className="strikethrough">Ashleigh</s> Ashley, and I’m a programmer. I mostly
                work on websites, but I’m open to new things. I work as an application support
                engineer and make side projects in my free time.
            </p>
            <p>Here&apos;s the rest of it if you&apos;re really curious:</p>
            <p>
                I started programming in early 2020 for a college class. At first it was just for my
                degree, but I actually really liked the class. So I took another programming class
                later on that year. That was when I started programming in my free time (I had a lot
                of free time in 2020). By mid-2022, I went all-in and went after a tech career. And
                now here we are.
