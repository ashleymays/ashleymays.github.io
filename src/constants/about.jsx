      Hi! I'm Ashley. I'm a software developer and educator in Orange County specializing in frontend and full stack web
      development.

      Looking back, I've always had an interest in engineering. As a kid, I dreamt about designing cars and building my
      very own Iron Man suit, but I didn't considered it a career path until college when I took a C++ class. It was the
      perfect combination of logic and art; exactly what I wanted. After that I found every excuse to program something.{" "}

      In the summer of 2021, I decided to turn software development into my career goal and learned web development to
      try something different from C++. Now I'm looking to join a great company as a junior software developer so that
      someday I can fund my own Iron Man suit. {linebreak}
      When I'm not at my desk, you can find me cycling around the city or reading something John Grisham wrote. I'm also
      studying coding techniques with the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, which is a pretty good read so far.
