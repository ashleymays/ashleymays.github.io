  introduction: (
    <>
      I've been programming for a few years, starting with a C++ class in college and web development later on. Now I
      teach others about programming and other technical concepts while seeking out employment as a full-time software
      developer.

      When I'm not at my desk, you can find me cycling around the city or reading something John Grisham wrote. I'm also
      studying coding techniques with the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, which is a pretty good read so far.

  background: (

      Looking back, I've always had an interest in engineering. As a kid, I dreamt about building cars and my very own
      Iron Man suit, but I didn't considered it a career path until college when I took a C++ class. It was the perfect
      combination of logic and art; exactly what I wanted.

      In 2021 I decided to pursue software development as a career. I learned web development because it was so
      different from what I'd done at the time (C++ applications). Now I'm looking to join a great company as a junior
      software developer so that someday I can fund my own Iron Man suit.
